# Jasper Reporting Engine

The version in the VERSION file matches the Jasper Reports version number.

This jar `JasperReportPrinter.jar` is called from the commandline to generate a Jasper report or send it to a printer.

Example of call (lines wrapped for clarity):

```bash
java -jar JasperReportPrinter.jar
    "full path to dir that houses reports"
    report_name
    "printer_address"
    "postgresql://host:port/database?user=username&password=password"
    "rpt_param1=1"
    "rpt_param2=VALUE"
    "MODE=GENERATE"
    "OUT_FILE_NAME=path_for_output_file_without_ext"
    "OUT_FILE_TYPE=PDF"
    "SUBREPORT_DIR=usually_same_as_first_dir_but_could_point_to_sub_dir"
```

The first four parameters are required: `reports directory`, `report name`, `printer`, `database connection`.

The paramters `rpt_param1` and `rpt_param2` are examples of parameters to be sent to the specific report.

MODE must be `GENERATE` or `PRINT`. When `GENERATE`, the printer address can be anything.

OUT_FILE_NAME is required for `GENERATE` and that is the name of the file to be created (but with no file extension).

OUT_FILE_TYPE is required for `GENERATE`. Can be `PDF`, `CSV`, `XLS` or `RTF`.

SUBREPORT_DIR is required - it will ususally be the same as the `reports directory`, but may point to a subdir if the report is below the `reports directory`.

Reports must be in a folder of the same name as `report_name`. e.g. `reports directory` = 'reports' and `report name` = 'invoice', there should be a report named `reports/invoice/invoice.jasper`.

## Debug Mode

When run in debug mode, the mode, output filename and parameters with their values will be logged to stdout.

To trigger debug mode, set the environment variable `DEBUG` on the commandline. e.g.:

```bash
DEBUG=y java -jar JasperReportPrinter.jar # â€¦
```

## Parameters

All parameters are sent to Jasper as strings unless one of the following conditions is met:

* The string can be converted to an integer. [Converts to `Integer`].  
  (Include `|string` after the value to force a numeric to string)
* The value has `|integer` at the end. [Converts to `Integer`].
* The value has `|boolean` at the end. [Converts to `Boolean`].
* The value has `|date` at the end. [Converts to `Timestamp`].
* The value has `|intarray` at the end. [Converts to `int[]`].

examples:

```bash
"param=ABC"                   # String
"param=123|string"            # String
"param=123"                   # Integer
"param=123|integer"           # Integer
"param=true|boolean"          # Boolean
"param=2020-01-01 12:00|date" # Timestamp
"param=1,2,3|intarray"        # int[]
```
